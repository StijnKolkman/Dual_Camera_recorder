Dual Camera Tracking and Trajectory Reconstruction

This script is designed to automate the process of:
1. Recording videos using two cameras through the DualCameraApp GUI.
2. Tracking UMR's in the recorded videos using VideoTracker.
3. Reconstructing and plotting the 3D trajectory of the UMR's using TrajectoryReconstructor.

Main Workflow:
- After the recording is completed, the 'on_recording_done' function is triggered.
- The recorded video files are passed to the VideoTracker to extract tracking data.
- The tracking data is saved in CSV format, which is then fed into the TrajectoryReconstructor for 3D trajectory reconstruction.
- Finally, the trajectory is plotted.

Dependencies:
- DualCameraApp (from RecorderClass.py): Provides GUI for dual camera video recording.
- VideoTracker (from TrackerClass.py): Tracks objects in video recordings.
- TrajectoryReconstructor (from TrajectoryClassV2.py): Reconstructs and plots the trajectory from tracking data.
